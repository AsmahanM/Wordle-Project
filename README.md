# Wordle

### The aim of this project is to...
...recreate specific features of the popular game, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>. 

  The user stories I focused on were:
  1. Allowing the user to enter letters into each tile;
  2. Allowing the user to press backspace to delete the previous letter; and
  3. Updating the colour of the tiles accordingly depending on the letter in each tile and its relevant position in the row.

I have chosen to work on these specific elements because they're the an integral part of the game and the changing tiles are personally one of my favourite features.

This project was completed using Semantic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I opted to build the actual letter board using a JavaScript for loop as opposed to with <span> tags as this allows me to manipulate the size of the board a lot quicker should I choose to alter its dimensions. It also meant my code was a lot more condensed as writing the board in HTML would have required many more lines of code.
