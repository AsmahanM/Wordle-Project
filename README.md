# Wordle

### The aim of this project is to be able to:
  1. Allow the user to enter letters into each tile;
  2. Allow the user to press backspace to delete the previous letter; and
  3. Update the colour of the tiles accordingly depending on the letter in each tile and its relevant position in the row.
